# EDA on Sales Data

Here, I done EDA on Sales data taken from Kaggle using Python libraries like :
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Note : Warnings is a module in Python used to handle warnings.

In this file, we have done :
* Fixed Missing Values
* Feature Enginnering
* Outliers Treatment
* Correcting incorrect values
* Reduce Skewness and try to make data normal

by various methods such as transformation, imputiong values and visualization to get a proper overview of data.
