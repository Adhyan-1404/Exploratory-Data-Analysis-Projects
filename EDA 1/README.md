# EDA on Sales Data

Here, I done EDA on Sales data taken from Kaggle using Python libraries like :
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Note : Warnings is a module in Python used to handle warnings.

In this file, we have done :
* Handled Missing Values
* Feature Enginnering
* Outliers Treatment
* Correcting incorrect values
* Summary Statistics
* Reduce Skewness and try to make data normal

by various methods such as transformation, imputiong values and visualization to get a proper overview of data.

NOTE : Location of CSV file must be changed in the file **EDA on Sales Data.ipynb** according to file location and new path must be used. Otherwise, code will give error.
The file **EDA on Sales Data.html** contains the executed code in an uneditable format, also containing the outputs we will get after executing the code.
